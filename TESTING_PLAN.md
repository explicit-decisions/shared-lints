# Systematic Testing and Validation Plan

## Core Functionality Tests

### âœ… Decisions System  
- [x] CLI basic commands work (`decisions check` passes)
- [x] All CLI commands work (init, add, list, review) 
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Can read/write TOML files correctly
- [x] Date calculations work properly

### âœ… ESLint Plugin System
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes for new rules
- [x] Plugin exports all rules properly
- [ ] Rules work correctly in isolation  
- [ ] Rules don't have false positives

### ðŸ”„ Build System
- [x] All TypeScript files compile cleanly
- [x] No unsafe any usage in production code
- [x] Import/export structure is clean
- [ ] Vitest config parsing issues resolved

## Error Categories to Address

### High Priority (Breaks functionality)
1. **TypeScript unsafe any usage** - 40+ errors in decisions system
2. **Missing return types** - ESLint plugin rules
3. **Console statements** - CLI needs console but strict rules block it

### Medium Priority (Code quality)
1. **Import order** issues
2. **Parsing errors** for vitest configs
3. **Deprecated ESLint APIs**

### Low Priority (Style)
1. **Factory function warnings** in tests
2. **Nullish coalescing** suggestions

## Systematic Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Core Type Safety (30 min)
- Fix decisions CLI TypeScript issues
- Add proper return types to ESLint rules
- Remove unsafe any usage

### Phase 2: Build System (15 min)  
- Fix vitest config parsing errors
- Ensure all TypeScript compiles cleanly

### Phase 3: ESLint Rules (20 min)
- Test ESLint rules in isolation
- Fix console statement rules for CLI context
- Update deprecated ESLint APIs

### Phase 4: Validation (15 min)
- Run full test suite
- Test all CLI commands manually
- Verify ESLint plugin works

## Safety Measures
- Test each change in isolation
- Run `pnpm lint` after each phase
- Keep decisions system working throughout
- Document any remaining technical debt
