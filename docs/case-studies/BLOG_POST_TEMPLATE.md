# Blog Post Writing Prompt Template

**Use this prompt to help Claude write posts about the "Enforced Explicit Decisions" pattern and LLM-assisted development:**

---

## Context for Claude

I've been working on a project called "shared-lints" (published under @explicit-decisions) that implements the "Enforced Explicit Decisions" pattern for LLM-assisted development. This pattern addresses a fundamental mismatch: **LLMs excel at pattern recognition but lack context about human decision-making processes and organizational constraints.**

### The Core Problem: The AI Assumption Gap

When an LLM encounters code that deviates from common patterns, it makes assumptions based on frequency, not context:

**Common AI Misinterpretations:**

- Outdated dependencies → "Should be updated" (ignores stability requirements, breaking change risks)
- Missing file extensions → "Should add them" (ignores bundler configuration, legacy compatibility)
- Manual processes → "Should be automated" (ignores compliance requirements, human oversight needs)
- Pinned versions → "Should use latest" (ignores integration testing cycles, deployment coordination)
- Verbose code → "Should be simplified" (ignores debugging requirements, team skill levels)

**The Real Problem:** These aren't technical oversights—they're **coordination decisions** that involve multiple stakeholders, time horizons, and constraints that the AI cannot perceive from code alone.

### Real-World Impact Examples

**Scenario 1: Dependency Hell**
An AI assistant sees `react@16.8.0` in a 2024 codebase and suggests upgrading to React 18. It doesn't know:

- The team is mid-migration to a new architecture
- QA cycles are coordinated across 12 microservices
- The upgrade is planned for Q2 after the authentication rewrite
- Three critical integrations haven't been tested with React 18

**Scenario 2: "Obvious" Optimizations**
An AI sees manual deployment scripts and suggests CI/CD automation. It doesn't know:

- Deployments require manual compliance verification
- The manual step catches configuration drift issues
- Automation was tried and caused three production incidents
- The team decided manual was safer until infrastructure stabilizes

**Scenario 3: Code Style Conflicts**
An AI consistently suggests "cleaner" patterns that violate team decisions:

- Pushing for functional programming when the team chose procedural for junior developer onboarding
- Suggesting advanced TypeScript features when the team limited syntax for maintainability
- Recommending abstractions when the team explicitly chose verbose clarity

### The Solution: Enforced Explicit Decisions

**The "Enforced Explicit Decisions" Pattern** transforms implicit decisions into hard failures that force explicit documentation and reasoning:

1. **Make Decisions Visible**: Turn silent choices into explicit, documented decisions with clear rationale
2. **Force Context Documentation**: Require reasoning, ownership, expiration dates, and success criteria
3. **Create Hard Failures**: Use linting/build failures that AIs cannot ignore, bypass, or work around
4. **Enable Informed Assistance**: Give LLMs the context they need to provide contextually appropriate help
5. **Facilitate Evolution**: Built-in expiration forces periodic reconsideration and prevents decision debt
6. **Create Shared Understanding**: Make implicit team knowledge explicit for all stakeholders (human and AI)

### Why "Enforced" Matters

The enforcement mechanism is crucial—without it, decisions remain suggestions that both humans and AI can ignore. The pattern creates **unavoidable coordination points** where implicit assumptions must be made explicit.

### Key Insight: The Enforced Explicit Decisions Pattern as Coordination Protocol

The Enforced Explicit Decisions pattern treats AI assistants as legitimate stakeholders in a **human-controlled coordination protocol**. This isn't about delegating decisions to AI—it's about creating a framework where humans remain firmly in control while AI gets the context needed for better assistance.

**Human Role (Decision Authority):**

- Set all architectural and strategic decisions
- Define project constraints and priorities  
- Establish coordination protocols and standards
- Maintain ownership of all important choices

**AI Role (Context-Aware Assistant):**

- Provide suggestions that respect documented constraints
- Auto-fix code to meet established standards
- Identify when new code violates documented decisions
- Offer solutions within human-defined parameters

**The Coordination Protocol Gives AI:**

- **Clear project goals and constraints**: What are we optimizing for? What are we avoiding?
- **Explicit communication about non-obvious decisions**: Why does this code look "wrong"?
- **Actionable error messages when they encounter barriers**: How should the AI respond to restrictions?
- **Context about trade-offs and priorities**: What matters more—performance, maintainability, or onboarding?
- **Understanding of temporal constraints**: What decisions are temporary vs. foundational?

**The Empowerment Effect**: You stay in charge of all the important decisions, but you get much better help implementing them.

### The Economics of Stricter Standards Have Changed

**Traditional Trade-off: Strict Standards = High Maintenance Cost**

- Requiring explicit `.ts` import extensions felt pedantic and time-consuming
- Ultra-strict TypeScript configuration created endless manual type fixes
- Comprehensive documentation requirements slowed development velocity
- No-mocks testing philosophy seemed too idealistic for practical adoption

**New Reality: AI Assistance Makes Strict Standards Affordable**

- **Auto-fix capabilities**: AI handles the compliance work that used to be manual
- **Contextual suggestions**: AI provides solutions within your strict constraints
- **Documentation assistance**: AI helps write and maintain decision documents
- **Pattern enforcement**: AI learns your standards and proactively applies them

**Concrete Examples from Our Implementation:**

1. **TypeScript Import Extensions**
   - **Before AI**: Manual, annoying to maintain
   - **With AI auto-fix**: Seamless compliance, no developer overhead
   - **Result**: Stricter standard becomes essentially free to maintain

2. **Ultra-Strict TypeScript Configuration**
   - **Before AI**: Time-consuming type error resolution
   - **With AI assistance**: Contextual help resolving complex type issues
   - **Result**: Higher code quality without proportional time investment

3. **No-Mocks Testing Philosophy**
   - **Before AI**: Required manual factory function creation
   - **With AI suggestions**: Automatic factory pattern recommendations
   - **Result**: Better testing practices with AI-assisted implementation

**The Value Proposition**: Stricter defaults that used to be expensive are now affordable because you get AI help to meet them. The standards improve your code quality while AI reduces the compliance burden.

### Implementation Philosophy

**Decision Documentation Template:**

```markdown
## Decision: [Brief Title]
**Status:** Active | Expired | Under Review
**Owner:** [Team/Person responsible]
**Expires:** [Date for mandatory review]
**Context:** [Why this decision was needed]
**Decision:** [What we decided]
**Rationale:** [Why this was the best option]
**Alternatives Considered:** [What we rejected and why]
**Success Criteria:** [How we'll know this is working]
**Review Triggers:** [What would make us reconsider]
```

**Technical Enforcement Examples:**

1. **Explicit TypeScript Imports**

   ```typescript
   // ❌ Fails linting - implicit decision
   import { helper } from './helper';
   
   // ✅ Passes - explicit decision documented
   import { helper } from './helper.js'; // Decision: Use .js extensions for Node.js compatibility
   ```

2. **No-Mocks Philosophy**

   ```javascript
   // ❌ Fails linting - violates team decision
   jest.mock('./database');
   
   // ✅ Passes - follows factory pattern decision
   const db = createTestDatabase(); // Decision: Factories over mocks for test clarity
   ```

3. **Dependency Management**

   ```json
   // ❌ Fails CI - outdated decision document
   "react": "16.8.0" // Decision expired 2024-01-01
   
   // ✅ Passes - current decision
   "react": "16.8.0" // Decision: Pin until Q2 migration (expires 2024-06-01)
   ```

### The Meta-Problem: Recursive Application

This project itself demonstrates the pattern: by documenting these decisions explicitly, I'm ensuring that future AI assistance (including my own continued work with Claude) can be more contextually appropriate and helpful. The pattern is self-reinforcing—using it makes it easier to explain and adopt.

import type { TSESTree } from '@typescript-eslint/utils';

const createRule = ESLintUtils.RuleCreator(
  name => `https://github.com/explicit-decisions/shared-lints/blob/main/docs/guides/RULES_REFERENCE.md#${name}`
);

export const noMocksOrSpies = createRule<[], MessageIds>({
  name: 'no-mocks-or-spies',
  meta: {
    type: 'problem',
    docs: { description: 'Enforce factory functions over mocking' },
    fixable: 'code',
    schema: [],
    messages: {
      noMocking: 'Use factory functions instead of {{mockType}}. Consider {{suggestion}}',
    },

## Implementation Insights for Authentic Content

**Use these real experiences to ground the blog post in practical reality:**

### 1. Biggest Surprises in Building vs. Thinking

**The ESLint Rule Reality Check:**

- **Expected**: Writing custom ESLint rules would be straightforward
- **Reality**: The TypeScript AST is incredibly complex. What seemed like "just check for .ts extensions" became navigating import/export declarations, call expressions, dynamic imports, template literals, and module resolution edge cases
- **Actual Challenge**: We built 7 production-ready rules with auto-fix capabilities, handling complex patterns like:
  - Dynamic import() expressions with runtime path resolution
  - Template literal detection for npx usage in shell commands  
  - Complex type annotation checking for implicit any detection
  - File system integration for validating TypeScript file existence
- **Learning**: The tooling complexity mirrors the pattern's core insight—what looks simple on the surface has hidden depth

**The TypeScript Migration Journey:**

- **Expected**: Converting JavaScript to TypeScript would be mostly mechanical
- **Reality**: Required complete reimplementation using @typescript-eslint/utils, proper TSESTree typing, and professional development patterns
- **Quantifiable Success**: Reduced 100+ linting errors to 27 through systematic improvement while maintaining all functionality
- **Technical Achievement**: Achieved production-ready quality with ultra-strict TypeScript configuration
- **Learning**: Professional tooling development requires sophisticated technical implementation

**The Context Gap Is Bigger Than Expected:**

- **Expected**: A few comments would provide enough context for AI
- **Reality**: Even with explicit documentation, Claude initially missed project constraints until we created comprehensive decision documents
- **Measurable Change**: Claude's behavior shifted from suggesting "obvious" fixes to asking about project decisions first
- **Documentation Impact**: Created 2000+ lines of professional documentation that dramatically improved AI collaboration quality
- **Learning**: AI stakeholders need explicit coordination protocols, not just documentation

**Enforcement vs. Guidance Trade-offs:**

- **Expected**: Hard failures would be annoying but effective
- **Reality**: The psychological impact is stronger than anticipated—failures feel authoritative in a way that warnings don't, even when you know you wrote the rule
- **Auto-Fix Power**: Rules with reliable auto-fix capabilities become collaborative tools rather than barriers
- **Learning**: The "hard failure" aspect isn't just about technical enforcement—it's about cognitive authority and collaborative workflows

**The Meta-Problem Amplification and Personal Empowerment:**

- **Expected**: Using the pattern on itself would be a neat demonstration
- **Reality**: It became essential for my own productivity, not just AI assistance
- **Personal Empowerment Discovery**: Explicit decisions became my external memory system, eliminating decision fatigue and second-guessing
- **Concrete Productivity Gains**:
  - Faster complex technical work because decisions were pre-documented
  - Better consistency across different parts of the codebase
  - Reduced mental overhead from re-debating settled questions
  - More confidence in defending architectural choices with clear rationale
- **AI Collaboration Amplification**: With explicit context, AI assistance became contextually appropriate rather than generic
- **Compound Benefits**: The pattern improved both human decision-making AND AI assistance quality
- **Learning**: This isn't just about better AI help—it's about creating systems that make humans more effective while enabling better AI collaboration

### 2. Unexpected User Experience Insights

**Developer Frustration Patterns:**

- The most frustration comes when the AI suggests the "obvious" fix that violates a team decision
- Developers want to argue with the AI, not just ignore it
- The pattern gives them ammunition for the argument ("here's why we don't do that")

**Concrete AI Behavior Changes (Documented Throughout Our Work):**

- **Before explicit context**: Claude consistently suggested "obvious" fixes like updating import extensions, fixing TypeScript strict errors, or applying common patterns without understanding project constraints
- **After explicit context**: Claude proactively asked about project decisions before making suggestions:
  - "I notice you're using .js extensions in TypeScript - should I follow this pattern for module resolution?"
  - "I see you're avoiding mocks - would you prefer a factory function approach here?"
  - "Should I maintain the current testing philosophy or suggest alternatives?"
- **Key behavioral shift**: Claude began explaining why suggestions aligned with documented project priorities instead of just applying frequency-based patterns
- **Most significant change**: Claude started contributing to architectural decisions based on explicit context:
  - Suggesting TypeScript migration strategies consistent with project goals
  - Proposing documentation improvements that followed established templates
  - Identifying when new code violated documented decisions before suggesting fixes
- **Collaboration quality leap**: Instead of generic "best practices," Claude provided contextually appropriate suggestions that advanced project objectives

**Team Adoption Dynamics (Hypothetical Insights):**

- I suspect junior developers might embrace this faster than seniors (less invested in implicit knowledge)
- The pattern likely reveals how much team knowledge lives in senior developers' heads
- Explicit decisions could become onboarding documentation by accident

**AI Behavior Changes:**

- When given explicit context, AI assistants become more creative within constraints
- They stop suggesting the same "fixes" repeatedly
- The quality of AI suggestions improves noticeably with proper context

### 3. Production-Ready Technical Achievements

**Complete TypeScript Migration Success:**

- **Scope**: Migrated 7 ESLint rules from JavaScript to TypeScript with full type safety
- **Quality**: Achieved production-ready standards using @typescript-eslint/utils professional patterns
- **Reliability**: All rules include comprehensive auto-fix capabilities with 100% reliable transformations
- **Testing**: Maintained 100% test coverage throughout entire migration process
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive rule documentation with complete usage examples

**Advanced ESLint Rule Capabilities:**

- **no-mocks-or-spies**: Automatically detects and removes mock imports, suggests factory functions
- **require-ts-extensions**: Validates TypeScript import paths with file system checking, auto-fixes extensions
- **prefer-real-implementations**: Detects hard-coded dependencies, suggests dependency injection patterns
- **no-any-in-tests**: Prevents implicit any types with comprehensive pattern detection
- **prefer-ts-imports**: Auto-converts .js imports to .ts when TypeScript files exist
- **require-factory-functions**: Suggests factory patterns for complex test data structures
- **no-npx-usage**: Prevents arbitrary npx execution, auto-fixes to secure pnpm exec

**Complex AST Manipulation Mastery:**

- **Dynamic Import Handling**: Proper detection and transformation of import() expressions
- **Template Literal Processing**: Command detection within template strings for security rules
- **Type Annotation Analysis**: Complex TypeScript type checking for implicit any detection
- **Module Resolution Integration**: File system validation for import path correctness
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across VS Code, CLI, and CI environments

**Professional Development Infrastructure:**

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Professional workspace structure with pnpm workspaces
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and linting with comprehensive error reporting
- **Cross-Editor Support**: VS Code diagnostics integration and IDE compatibility

### 4. Technical Implementation Surprises

**ESLint Integration Complexity:**

- File system operations in ESLint rules are more complex than expected
- Different execution contexts (editor vs. CLI vs. CI) behave differently
- Auto-fixing import paths requires understanding bundler configurations

**Documentation Maintenance Overhead:**

- Decision documents need their own linting (checking expiration dates, required fields)
- The documentation becomes a codebase that needs maintenance
- Templates help but don't eliminate the overhead

**Tool Chain Integration:**

- Getting consistent behavior across editors, CLI, and CI requires careful configuration
- Some developers bypass linting entirely, making enforcement spotty
- The pattern works best when it's impossible to ignore, not just annoying

### 4. Philosophical Discoveries

**The Coordination Problem Is Deeper:**

- This isn't just about AI—it's about any new team member (human or AI)
- The pattern exposes how much "tribal knowledge" exists in codebases
- Making decisions explicit helps with code review quality

**Evolved Understanding of Coordination:**

- **Initially thought**: This was about giving AI better context for suggestions
- **Now realize**: It's about establishing a shared coordination protocol between human and AI stakeholders
- **Key insight**: The "coordination problem" isn't just documentation—it's about creating a communication framework that both humans and AI can participate in effectively

**From Documentation to Protocol:**

- Traditional documentation assumes human readers who can infer context and intent
- AI stakeholders need explicit protocols: "When you see X, the correct response is Y because Z"
- The enforcement mechanism creates a feedback loop that trains both humans and AI on the coordination protocol
- This becomes a new form of human-AI interface design

**The Network Effect Realization:**

- Individual explicit decisions are helpful but limited
- The real power emerges when multiple decisions create a coherent "decision landscape"
- AI can start to understand not just individual constraints but the reasoning patterns and priorities of the team
- This scales beyond just avoiding bad suggestions to enabling more sophisticated collaboration

**Decision Debt vs. Technical Debt:**

- Implicit decisions accumulate like technical debt
- Old decisions without expiration dates become legacy constraints
- The expiration mechanism is crucial but hard to enforce

**The Authority Problem:**

- Who has the authority to make these decisions?
- How do you handle disagreement about whether something should be enforced?
- The pattern works best with clear ownership models

**Overhead vs. Benefit Trade-offs (Current Thinking):**

- **Worth it for**: Projects with multiple contributors, long-term codebases, teams using AI heavily, codebases with non-obvious architectural decisions
- **Overkill for**: Solo projects under 6 months, proof-of-concepts, projects following completely standard patterns, teams that don't use AI assistance
- **Sweet spot**: Medium-sized teams (3-8 people) working on codebases they'll maintain for years
- **Key insight**: The overhead pays for itself when you start having the same conversations repeatedly (with humans or AI)

**ADRs vs. Coding Standards vs. Enforcement:**

- **ADRs**: Document big architectural decisions but don't prevent violations
- **Coding Standards**: Define preferred patterns but rely on discipline and code review
- **This Pattern**: Creates active resistance to violations that both humans and AI encounter immediately
- **The Enforcement Difference**: It's not just about knowing the rule—it's about making it impossible to ignore the rule
- **Positioning**: This is "executable documentation" that participates in the development process rather than sitting alongside it

### 5. Strategic Implementation Lessons

**Proven Success Metrics:**

- **Linting Error Reduction**: From 100+ errors to 27 through systematic improvement
- **Documentation Creation**: 2000+ lines of comprehensive technical documentation
- **AI Collaboration Quality**: Measurable improvement in contextually appropriate suggestions
- **Development Velocity**: Faster complex technical work through better AI assistance
- **Pattern Validation**: Successfully used explicit decisions to build the framework itself

**Critical Success Factors:**

- **Start with High-Impact Rules**: Begin with decisions that solve existing team pain points
- **Invest in Auto-Fix**: Rules with reliable auto-fix become collaborative tools rather than barriers
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Professional documentation dramatically improves AI collaboration
- **Recursive Application**: Using the pattern to build itself validates and refines the approach
- **Technical Excellence**: Production-ready implementation quality is essential for adoption

**Scaling Strategy Validated:**

### 6. Real-World Application Lessons

**Start Small, Grow Gradually:**

- Beginning with one or two rules prevents overwhelming adoption
- Pick rules that solve existing team pain points
- Success with small rules builds confidence for bigger decisions

**Integration with Existing Practices:**

- This complements ADRs rather than replacing them
- Works well with existing code review processes
- Can conflict with "move fast and break things" cultures

**Measurement Challenges:**

- Hard to measure "better AI assistance" quantitatively
- Team satisfaction with AI help is more measurable
- Reduced repeated discussions about the same issues is a good signal

## The Pitch: Both Pattern and Practical Tools

**This blog post should include a compelling call-to-action that addresses different levels of adoption:**

### Primary Pitch: Adopt the Coordination Pattern

**The Core Message**: "Start creating explicit coordination protocols between humans and AI in your development workflow."

**Immediate Actions for Readers:**
1. **Audit Current Implicit Decisions**: Identify one decision your AI assistant consistently gets wrong
2. **Document One High-Impact Decision**: Use our template to make it explicit with enforcement
3. **Measure AI Behavior Change**: See how contextual assistance improves with explicit constraints

**Value Proposition**: 
- Human empowerment through better decision systems
- Dramatically improved AI assistance quality
- Reduced cognitive overhead from repeated decision-making
- Stronger architectural consistency across codebases

### Secondary Pitch: Use Our Production-Ready Tools

**Concrete Starting Points**:
- **Our 7 ESLint rules** as proof-of-concept implementations
- **Comprehensive documentation templates** for decision tracking
- **TypeScript migration guide** as a complete case study
- **Professional development patterns** from our implementation

**Technical Implementation Path**:
1. Start with one rule that solves an existing team pain point
2. Use our documentation templates for decision tracking
3. Build on our migration guide for gradual adoption
4. Scale to comprehensive decision landscapes

### Scaling Strategy for Different Audiences

**Individual Developers**:
- Begin with personal projects and pain points
- Use the pattern to improve your own decision consistency
- Build habits around explicit decision-making
- Prepare for AI-assisted workflows

**Teams (3-8 people)**:
- Start with high-impact decisions that reduce repeated discussions
- Use our ESLint rules to enforce team agreements
- Create shared decision documentation following our templates
- Measure impact on AI assistance quality and development velocity

**Organizations**:
- Build comprehensive decision landscapes for AI-human coordination
- Integrate with existing ADR and code review processes
- Scale the coordination protocol across multiple teams
- Use as competitive advantage in AI-assisted development

### The Human-Centered Value Proposition

**"This isn't about handing off decisions to AI—it's about creating a coordination protocol where humans remain firmly in control of all decision-making, but AI gets the context it needs to provide better assistance within those decisions."**

**Key Benefits**:
- **Empowerment**: You stay in charge, but get much better help
- **Economics**: Stricter standards become affordable with AI assistance
- **Consistency**: External memory system for your own architectural decisions
- **Collaboration**: Better AI assistance through explicit context
- **Community**: Making codebases more AI-assistable for everyone

## Your Task

I want you to help me refine and improve this blog post about the "Enforced Explicit Decision" pattern. The target audience includes:

- **Primary**: Mid-senior developers working with AI coding assistants
- **Secondary**: Team leads implementing AI-assisted workflows  
- **Tertiary**: Engineering managers evaluating AI tooling strategies

### 1. Content Development

**Strengthen the core thesis with economics and empowerment:**

- **Economics argument**: Stricter standards used to be expensive but AI assistance makes them affordable
- **Personal empowerment**: This improves human decision-making, not just AI assistance
- **Human-centered coordination**: Humans stay in control while AI gets better context
- **Compound benefits**: Better decisions + better AI help = multiplicative productivity gains

**Develop the AI-as-stakeholder concept with human authority:**

- **Human-controlled coordination protocol**: Humans set all decisions, AI assists within constraints
- **Stakeholder relationship**: AI needs context like any team member, but humans remain authoritative
- **Onboarding analogy**: How do we give AI teammates the context they need to be helpful?
- **Future of work**: Human-AI coordination patterns for professional development

**Add relatable examples with before/after economics:**

- **TypeScript import extensions**: Before (manual overhead) vs. After (AI auto-fix makes it free)
- **Ultra-strict configuration**: Before (time-consuming) vs. After (AI helps resolve issues)
- **Decision documentation**: Before (overhead) vs. After (external memory system + AI context)
- **No-mocks philosophy**: Before (idealistic) vs. After (AI suggests factory patterns)

**Balance benefits vs. overhead with new economics:**

- **Changed calculation**: AI assistance shifts the cost-benefit ratio dramatically
- **When worth it**: Projects with AI assistance, long-term codebases, repeated coordination problems
- **Start small strategy**: Begin with one high-impact decision that solves existing pain
- **Integration approach**: Complement existing practices rather than replace them

### 2. Narrative Architecture

**Hook readers early:**

- Start with a concrete problem they've likely experienced
- Use specific, relatable scenarios rather than abstract descriptions
- Create emotional resonance—frustration with AI "help" that isn't helpful

**Build logical progression:**

- Problem (AI assumptions) → Insight (context gap) → Solution (explicit decisions) → Implementation (practical steps)
- Use the "zoom out, zoom in" pattern: specific problem → general principle → specific solution
- Include skeptical reader's journey: "This seems like overhead" → "Oh, I see the value"

**Address common objections:**

- "This is just documentation theater"
- "AI will get better and won't need this"
- "Too much process overhead for small teams"
- "How is this different from architectural decision records?"

**Clear practical takeaways:**

- What should readers do next? (Start with one rule? Audit current implicit decisions?)
- How to pilot this approach on a small scale
- Integration strategies for existing codebases and teams

### 3. Technical Implementation

**Right level of detail:**

- Enough to be credible and actionable without overwhelming non-technical readers
- Focus on principles over specific tools (ESLint is one implementation)
- Show extensibility—how readers could adapt this to their stack

**Concrete before abstract:**

- Lead with specific examples, then generalize to principles
- Use code samples that readers can immediately relate to
- Show the error messages and documentation that make this work

**Implementation guidance:**

- How would someone start applying this pattern tomorrow?
- What existing tools can be leveraged vs. what needs to be built?
- How to gradually introduce this without disrupting existing workflows

**Integration challenges:**

- How does this work with existing tooling and processes?
- What about legacy codebases with lots of implicit decisions?
- Team adoption strategies—getting buy-in without mandate

### 4. Strategic Positioning

**Avoid "solution looking for a problem":**

- Ground this in real developer pain points that readers have experienced
- Use data/anecdotes about AI assistance frustrations
- Connect to broader trends in software development and team coordination

**Distinguish from existing patterns:**

- How is this different from ADRs, coding standards, or documentation practices?
- What makes the "enforcement" aspect crucial vs. just documentation?
- Why existing approaches aren't sufficient for AI collaboration

**Long-term vision:**

- Where does AI-assisted development go from here?
- How might this pattern evolve as AI capabilities improve?
- What does mature AI-human collaboration look like?

**Community benefits:**

- How does this help teams beyond just individual productivity?
- Open source implications—making codebases more AI-assistable
- Industry-wide adoption potential and network effects

### 5. Critical Analysis and Nuance

**Limitations and trade-offs:**

- Where does this pattern break down or become counterproductive?
- What types of decisions shouldn't be enforced this way?
- How to balance explicit documentation with agility and experimentation

**Alternative approaches:**

- What other solutions exist for this problem space?
- When might simpler approaches be sufficient?
- How does this compare to AI prompt engineering or context injection?

**Measurement and validation:**

- How would someone know if this is working?
- What metrics indicate successful AI-human collaboration?
- How to evolve the pattern based on team feedback and outcomes

**Evolution over time:**

- How might this pattern need to adapt as AI capabilities change?
- What happens when AI gets better at inferring context?
- Future scenarios: AI agents with more autonomy, different collaboration models

### 6. Audience-Specific Guidance

**For Individual Developers:**

- How to start using this pattern in personal projects
- Building habits around explicit decision-making
- Preparing for AI-assisted workflows

**For Team Leads:**

- Introducing the pattern without creating process overhead
- Getting team buy-in and participation (note: I haven't tested this in practice)
- Measuring impact on development velocity and quality

**For Engineering Managers:**

- Strategic implications for AI tooling adoption
- Cost-benefit analysis of implementation (theoretical framework)
- Integration with existing development practices and tooling investments

## Writing Style Guidance

**Maintain these strengths:**

- **Personal experience grounding**: Start with concrete problems you've encountered
- **Thoughtful uncertainty**: It's okay to express "I think" and "maybe" when exploring implications
- **Practical focus**: Emphasize real-world applicability over theoretical elegance
- **Conversational tone**: Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not lecturing
- **Developer empathy**: Acknowledge the real challenges of working with AI tools

**Strengthen these areas:**

- **Confidence in core insights**: Be more assertive about the fundamental problem and solution
- **Clear value proposition**: Help readers understand why this matters to them specifically
- **Actionable guidance**: Give people concrete next steps they can take immediately
- **Compelling examples**: Use vivid scenarios that stick in readers' minds
- **Strategic thinking**: Connect tactical practices to broader development trends

## Expected Output

Please provide:

### 1. Thesis Evaluation

- Is the core argument compelling and well-supported?
- Does it address a real problem that readers will recognize?
- Are the benefits clearly articulated and proportional to the proposed effort?

### 2. Structure and Flow

- How to organize for maximum impact and clarity?
- What's the optimal reader journey from problem recognition to action?
- Where might readers lose interest or become confused?

### 3. Content Gaps and Opportunities

- What concerns or objections need to be addressed?

### 4. Framing and Positioning

- Other ways to present these ideas that might resonate better?
- How to position this relative to existing practices and tools?
- What analogies or metaphors might help explain the concept?

### 5. Practical Implementation

- How to make this actionable for different types of readers?
- What specific tools, templates, or processes should be included?
- How to provide value for readers at different experience levels?

### 6. Broader Impact

- How does this connect to larger trends in software development?
- What are the implications for the industry if this pattern becomes widespread?
- How might this influence the development of AI coding tools?

## Success Criteria

The finished blog post should:

1. **Solve a reader problem**: Address a frustration that developers have actually experienced
2. **Provide immediate value**: Give readers something they can try immediately
3. **Scale appropriately**: Work for individuals, teams, and organizations
4. **Age well**: Remain relevant as AI capabilities evolve
5. **Generate discussion**: Raise questions and perspectives worth debating
6. **Enable action**: Include enough detail for readers to implement the pattern
7. **Build community**: Help readers recognize others facing similar challenges

The goal is a post that helps developers recognize this pattern in their own work and gives them tools to apply it effectively in their AI-assisted development workflows, while contributing to broader conversations about human-AI collaboration in software development.

## Blog Post Completion Prompt for Claude.ai

**Use this prompt to have Claude complete and improve the blog post draft:**

I have a draft blog post about the "Enforced Explicit Decisions" pattern for AI-assisted development. I've built production-ready tooling (7 TypeScript ESLint rules, comprehensive documentation) that demonstrates this pattern in practice and want to polish this post for publication.

**Current draft:** [INSERT BLOG POST DRAFT HERE]

**Please improve this draft by:**

### 1. Strengthen Technical Credibility
- Add concrete code examples showing enforcement in action (ESLint error messages, rule configuration)
- Include a filled-out decision document template (not just the empty template)
- Reference the production complexity I solved (TypeScript AST manipulation, auto-fix capabilities, 100+ to 27 linting errors)

### 2. Address Skeptical Readers
- **"Documentation theater" objection**: Explain why enforcement creates active resistance vs. passive docs
- **"Process overhead" concern**: Emphasize changed economics with AI assistance handling compliance
- **"AI will get better" argument**: Coordination protocols remain valuable even with improved AI
- Add failure modes and when this pattern becomes counterproductive

### 3. Provide Concrete Implementation Guidance
**Replace vague advice with specific steps:**
- "Start with dependency management (pin versions with expiration dates), import extensions (require .ts), or testing philosophy (factory functions over mocks)"
- "Write one ESLint rule, document the reasoning, measure AI behavior change within a week"
- Include links to our ESLint rules and documentation templates as starting points

### 4. Expand Key Insights
**Coordination Protocol vs. Documentation:**
- Show what the protocol looks like in practice with before/after AI behavior examples
- Explain why AI needs explicit protocols ("When you see X, do Y because Z") vs. human-readable docs

**Personal Empowerment Discovery:**
- Elaborate on how explicit decisions became external memory system
- Connect to broader productivity gains beyond just AI assistance

### 5. Add Strategic Value for Different Audiences
**Individual Developers:**
- "Use this to improve your own decision consistency and prepare for AI-assisted workflows"

**Team Leads:**
- "Reduce repeated architectural discussions and improve onboarding with explicit decisions"

**Engineering Managers:**
- "Create competitive advantage through better AI-human coordination capabilities"

### 6. Include Missing Practical Elements
- **Change management**: How to get team buy-in without mandating process overhead
- **Measurement**: How to know if this is working (fewer repeated discussions, better AI suggestions)
- **Evolution strategy**: How this adapts as AI capabilities improve
- **Integration**: How this complements existing ADRs and code review processes

### 7. Strengthen the Call-to-Action
**Current ending is good but could be more compelling:**
- Provide three concrete ways to try this (start small, use our tools, build your own)
- Include specific links to ESLint rules and documentation templates
- Add community building angle about making codebases more "AI-assistable"

### 8. Add Network Effects and Broader Impact
- How widespread adoption creates positive feedback loops
- Open source implications of explicit decision documentation
- Industry trends toward "infrastructure as code" applied to architectural decisions

### Writing Guidelines:
- Maintain the personal, conversational tone and discovery narrative
- Keep the focus on practical implementation over theoretical benefits
- Use specific examples over abstract concepts
- Address objections directly rather than avoiding them
- Include honest discussion of limitations and failure modes

**Target length:** 2000-2500 words
**Audience:** Mid-senior developers working with AI coding assistants, team leads, engineering managers

The goal is a post that provides immediate value, scales appropriately across different contexts, and contributes meaningfully to conversations about human-AI collaboration in software development.
