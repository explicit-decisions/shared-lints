# Development Priorities Framework

## Three-Tier Development Priority System

**Rationale:** Adopting DoctorWhoScripts-inspired priority framework to ensure high-impact improvements over feature proliferation

**Decision:** Use three-tier system for all shared-lints development priorities:

### ⚡ High-Leverage Improvements

**Criteria:** <1 hour effort, high user impact, zero breaking changes
**Philosophy:** "Make existing features noticeably better before adding new features"

**Examples:**

- ESLint rule error message improvements
- Auto-fix capability enhancements
- Documentation clarifications and examples
- Configuration option additions to existing rules
- Performance optimizations for existing functionality

**Priority:** Always complete these first

### 🏗️ Foundation Enhancements  

**Criteria:** 1-3 hours effort, enables future features, reduces technical debt
**Philosophy:** "Build infrastructure that makes everything else easier"

**Examples:**

- Rule architecture refactoring for better maintainability
- Testing infrastructure improvements
- TypeScript configuration enhancements
- Development workflow optimizations
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements

**Priority:** Complete after all high-leverage items

### 🚀 New Feature Development

**Criteria:** 3+ hours effort, uncertain value proposition, potential breaking changes
**Philosophy:** "Only add new features when existing foundation is solid"

**Examples:**

- Additional ESLint rule categories
- IDE integrations beyond basic ESLint support
- New tooling packages in the monorepo
- Experimental rule patterns
- Integration with external tools

**Priority:** Complete only when foundation is strong

## Implementation Guidelines

### Decision Process

1. **Categorize first:** Every improvement must fit into one tier
2. **Justify the tier:** Document why it belongs in that category
3. **Respect dependencies:** Never skip tiers for "urgent" features
4. **Review regularly:** Reassess categorization as project evolves

### Current Backlog Categorization

#### ⚡ High-Leverage (Immediate)

- [ ] Improve `require-ts-extensions` error messages with specific file paths
- [ ] Add configuration options to `no-mocks-or-spies` for approved mock libraries
- [ ] Enhance auto-fix reliability across all rules
- [ ] Update README with clearer getting-started instructions

#### 🏗️ Foundation (Next)

- [ ] Create `docs/principles/` directory structure  
- [ ] Implement dependency decision tracking system
- [ ] Establish configuration standards framework
- [ ] Create rule development templates and tooling

#### 🚀 New Features (Future)

- [ ] `require-explicit-package-decisions` rule implementation
- [ ] `prefer-platform-features` rule for native API usage
- [ ] IDE extension for decision document management
- [ ] Integration with popular CI/CD platforms

## Success Metrics

### High-Leverage Success

- **User feedback:** "This made my existing workflow noticeably better"
- **Adoption:** Increased usage of existing features
- **Support:** Fewer questions about how to use existing functionality

### Foundation Success  

- **Developer velocity:** New feature development becomes faster
- **Maintenance:** Bug fixes and updates become easier
- **Extensibility:** Third-party contributions increase

### New Feature Success

- **Unique value:** Provides capabilities not available elsewhere
- **Sustainable:** Can be maintained long-term without technical debt
- **Adopted:** Users actually enable and benefit from the feature

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### "Shiny Object" Syndrome

- **Problem:** Jumping to new features because they're more interesting
- **Solution:** Force completion of high-leverage improvements first
- **Test:** "Would users prefer this new thing or fixing existing annoyances?"

### "Perfect Infrastructure" Trap

- **Problem:** Over-investing in foundation work that never delivers user value
- **Solution:** Foundation work must enable specific user-facing improvements
- **Test:** "What user problems will this foundation work solve?"

### "Feature Creep" Expansion

- **Problem:** Adding scope to simple improvements until they become complex features
- **Solution:** Strict scope discipline, break large changes into smaller tiers
- **Test:** "Can this be delivered in the promised time with the promised impact?"

## Review Triggers

**Monthly Review:** Assess if categorization still makes sense
**Before Major Releases:** Ensure high-leverage items are complete
**User Feedback:** Recategorize based on actual usage patterns
**Team Changes:** Revisit when development capacity changes

## Alternatives Considered

**Linear Priority List:** Rejected because it doesn't distinguish effort vs. impact
**Kanban Boards:** Rejected because it doesn't enforce philosophical discipline
**Story Points:** Rejected because time estimates are more actionable for small team

## Success Criteria

- **All improvements are categorized** before development begins
- **High-leverage improvements are prioritized** consistently over new features  
- **Foundation work enables** measurable improvements in development velocity
- **New features deliver unique value** that justifies their maintenance cost
